Everywhere I search, it has to be some company's fancy client software with an installer.\nI'm working on a machine where I don't have administrator account. Just give me the plain command-line binaries, where the hell are they?\n\n\nCandidate answers:\nA1:\n\nKris Erickson is right, vote him up. In my case the problem was installing TFS powertools , which adds explorer shell integration just like TSVN and TCVS. It adds another 5 overlays. Since they are prefixed with Tfs*, they take priority over Tortoise*. I also just prefixed the Tfs stuff with z_ and the TSVN overlays came back. No need to reboot/logoff though, just kill explorer.exe and start it again.\n\n\nA2:\n\nTwo other possible solutions:\n\nKill TSVNCache.exe and let it re-launch.  This has caused my shell overlay icons to re-appear on several occasions.\nIf you've recently upgraded TortoiseSVN from a previous version, you may need to upgrade your working copy.  This can be done by right-clicking on your project folder and choose \"SVN Upgrade working copy\" from the context menu.\n\n\n\nA3:\n\nsvn propset svn:executable \"*\" someScript\nThe syntax is propset key value so svn:executable is the key and \"*\" is the value\nsomeScript is the filename\n\n\nA4:\n\nI resolved it by using Autoruns from Sysinternals.\n\nRun Autoruns\nIn the 'Explorer' tab, scroll down to the 'OverlayIconIdentifier' and 'ShellOverlayIconIdentifier' entries\nUn-tick unwanted overlays (such as most of any Dropbox, SkyDrive etc.)\nRestart Explorer.exe\n\n\n\n\nA5:\n\nAll of these solutions setup the standard Apache HTTPD server with Subversion integration. They do no real magic.\nUberSVN and VisualSVN provide a pretty front end interface, but behind the scenes, it's just standard Apache setup. If you are not a CM, and don't want that to be your job, that's not a bad alternative. However, do not ever try to tweak the configuration behind their backs. They will either revert the changes, or really mess things up.\nHowever, I use Apache httpd in order to access my Windows Active Directory. I setup my users, so their Windows account and password are their Subversion account and password. I setup a Active Directory Security Group or a Active Directory Exchange Group as my authorization database. If a user is a member of this group, they have access to the repository via their Windows login. If not, they don't have access. Clean and simple. I am no longer in the user authorization business which gives me more time to play Candy Crush ..I mean.. other CM work.\nOtherwise, I might as well just use svnserve: It's faster than Apache httpd, much easier to setup, and more stable too.\nIf you're not going to use Active Directory as your authorization backend, you are technical, and don't mind getting your hands a bit dirty, I would use either play svnserve (and set it up as a Windows Service. No need for any of these packages.\nIf you are going to use Active Directory as your authorization backend (and why not?), I would use CollabNet Subversion Edge to help setup Apache httpd and Subversion and do all of my configuration manually. Setting up Active Directory via LDAP via Apache httpd isn't really that difficult, and once done, you probably never have to touch again. The documentation on integrating Apache httpd/Subversion/LDAP/ActiveDirectory can easily be found.\nI suggest you look at the on line Subversion Documentation and go through it. If thinking about using the svn command line client makes you woozy, then get VisualSVN or UberSVN and let them take care of things for you. If you don't mind going all 1990 with your computer, then forget about the pretty front ends, and use CollabNet Edge.\nOne more thing, I am not a fan of ViewVC that comes with CollabNet Edge. It has to use file:// protocol and must run on the same server as your Subversion server software. Instead, I prefer Sventon. It can run on a separate server, and you can use the same credentials as your standard Subversion credentials. Plus, I like the interface a bit better.\n\n\nA6:\n\nAlso restarting your PC is not needed. Instead restart explorer.exe:\n\nPress Ctrl+Shift+Esc.\nClick the Processes tab.\nRight-click on explorer.exe.\nSelect End Process.\nClick End Process button.\nClick the Applications tab.\nRight-click.\nClick New Task (Run).\nSet Open to: explorer\nClick OK.\n\nWindows Explorer has restarted and the TortoiseSVN icons reappear.\n\n\nA7:\n\nhttp://subversion.tigris.org/\nThe client-side binaries ship with the source, as well as several other packaged installers.\n\n\nA8:\n\nSVN ignores UNIX file permissions when commiting. The way that you set exec permissions on a file is to change the svn properties for that file. If you are on Windows, the easy way to do this is to install Tortoise SVN. Then after you have committed, use Tortoise to open the repo-browser. Find a file that needs to be executable and right-click it to open properties.\nThe dialog that appears is the SVN properties dialog. Click New to add a new property, select svn:executable from the dropdown list, and set the property value to *.\nThat's it. When you click OK, it is committed to the SVN repo. The next time you, or the build machine, do an svn update, that file will have executable permissions on Unix/Linux.\n\n\nA9:\n\nI suggest complaining to Microsoft regarding the ridiculously low icon overlay limit.  If enough of us complain, perhaps they'll fix the true root cause of this problem:\nSee comments at bottom of page:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144123(VS.85).aspx\nGive Microsoft Windows 7 team feedback on this issue:\nhttp://mymfe.microsoft.com/Windows%207/Feedback.aspx?formID=195\n\n\nA10:\n\nMy icons had disappeared too. The registry fixes did not work for me either.\nThis is how I got them back:\n\ninstall the latest version of TortoiseOverlays \nrestart explorer.exe\n\n\n\nA11:\n\nSame problem for me. It turns out that the cause of the problem was the new JungleDisk 3.0, which rudely installs three overlays named \"1Sync...\" \"2Sync...\" and \"3Sync...\" pushing the Tortoise ones off the end. \nJust delete those JungleDisk keys in the reg hive listed at the top (or prefix them with z_) and re-start the system and Tortoise should work fine again. \nGiven that this overlay limit exists in Windows and is easily hit with current tools, tool vendors really should ask during advanced installation if the user wants to install them. I have no need nor desire for the new \"Sync\" feature and don't really care for the tactic of stuffing the icons at the top of the list with clever naming. Shame on JungleDisk.\n\n\nA12:\n\nActually, I had this problem same as you.\nMy windows is server 2008 and my subversion info is :\nTortoiseSVN 1.7.6, Build 22632 - 64 Bit , 2012/03/08 18:29:39\nSubversion 1.7.4, \napr 1.4.5\napr-utils 1.3.12\nneon 0.29.6\nOpenSSL 1.0.0g 18 Jan 2012\nzlib 1.2.5\nI used this way and I solved this problem.\nI used [group] option. this option makes problem. \nI rewrite authz file contents.\nI remove group option. and I set one by one.\nI use well.\nThanks for reading.\n\n\nA13:\n\nWindows can only show a limited number of Overlay Icons (15 total, 11 after what Windows uses).  Programs like Office Groove, Dropbox, Mozy, Carbonite, etc, will hijack a bunch of the 11 possible overlay icons (boy would it be nice if Microsoft upped the number of these as the number of applications that use them seem to increase and increase)...\nYou can see what overlays are set up, and change them (at your own risk) in the registry here:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\explorer\\ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers\nIf you are using TortoiseCVS (and have nothing else using overlay icons), you will get a couple of TortoiseSVN Icons, and all of your TortoiseCVS icons.  This is because the overlay icons are used in alphabetical order. Again, at your own risk (editing the registry may blow up your computer, yada, yada, yada -- and if you are reading Stack Overflow and using Windows and haven't edited the registry, you are a rare beast indeed), feel free to rename them (I suggest putting numbers in front of the ones you want to use and \"z_\"'s prefixed to the ones you don't need).  The TortoiseSVN Shell extensions are nicely named so you know what they do, the TortoiseCVS extensions are not.  After looking through the source code, I found the pertinent information:\n\nTortoiseCVS0 - In CVS\nTortoiseCVS1 - Not in CVS\nTortoiseCVS3 - Conflicted\nTortoiseCVS4 - In CVS readonly\nTortoiseCVS5 - Ignored\nTortoiseCVS6 - Added\nTortoiseCVS7 - Deleted\nTortoiseCVS8 - Locked\n\n\n\nA14:\n\nAs a new user to these two software packages, I experienced the exact same problem.  As was also discovered above, my solution was to use the same case letters as is in the Repository path.\nHere's a tip that I find helpful:  In VisualSVN, you can right click on the path, then click \"Copy URL to Clipboard\" for pasting in Tortoise to be sure that the path is the identical case.\n\n\nA15:\n\nI had the same issue as the OP: Win 7 (x64), TortoiseSVN (x64), and DropBox (x86). The info from some of the other answers gave me all the info. I've only ever had the x64 version of TSVN installed on this machine. \nIn my case TSVN and DropBox were installed the same day I did the OS install and the overlays worked fine until a couple of days ago. I did nothing involving changing settings for either app to cause them to stop working.\nHere is what I had in the icon overlay registry section after the problem started (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\explorer\\ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers): \n\nDropboxExt1\nDropboxExt2\nDropboxExt3\nEnhancedStorageShell\nOffline Files\nSharingPrivate\nTortoiseAdded\nTortoiseConflict\nTortoiseDeleted\nTortoiseIgnored\nTortoiseLocked\nTortoiseModified\nTortoiseNormal\nTortoiseReadOnly\nTortoiseUnversioned\n\nI verified that only the overlays corresponding to the first 11 entries display in Explorer. When I modified the order of above entries by adding 'z' to the start of some of them, again only the first 11 overlays (under the updated order) would display. \nWith the above I had everything I needed to solve the problem (either rename or or delete entries so that the TSVN entries I want working are <= #11 on the list). Below deals with wondering why this suddenly happened.\nI know that based on the overlays that worked prior to a couple of days ago, keys 1-3, 7-9, 12-13 were all <= 11 in the list (not sure if overlay #14 ever worked since I never had files w/ read-only status. #15 never worked on this machine so i know it was never in the top 11). I also assume the block of TSVN keys move up/down in unison, therefore they were bumped down either two or three places (* see below). This implies that 2-3 items were added between the DropBox & TSVN blocks. The three that are there now are added by Windows and I would assume they'd be there as soon as the OS installed. \nIs the list of 15 overlays determined at run-time? Seems like the overlay handlers might sometimes tell the windows shell that there are no icons to add to the list. Possibly some settings I messed with a couple of days ago related to file sharing and file encryption caused some of those items at the 4-6 spots to become \"activated\" and push the SVN ones down.\nIn the end I deleted a couple of entries and moved some, so my final list looks like this: \n\nDropboxExt1\nDropboxExt2\nDropboxExt3\nSharingPrivate (i want this to show up)\nTortoiseAdded\nTortoiseConflict\nTortoiseDeleted\nTortoiseModified\nTortoiseNormal\nTortoiseReadOnly\nTortoiseUnversioned\nzOffline Files (i don't use Sync Center, or \"Offline Files\" so I don't care about this)\nzEnhancedStorageShell (don't really know what Enhanced Storage is, don't think I need this)\n\n\n\nA16:\n\nWe chose VisualSVN bec it makes it easy to use windows authentication instead of having a separate SVN user.\nOther benefits is an easy to use GUI for permission management and for managing SVN hooks.\nThe one thing I'm not a real fan of is the web GUI. As far as I know you cannot view web based diffs, so if that makes a difference.... \n\n\nA17:\n\nTry UberSVN http://www.wandisco.com/ubersvn/download#windows\nThe only downside is that is requires lot of server memory. Best free SVN server I ever tried. VisualSVN free version is OK as well.\n\n\nA18:\n\nI've just configured win32svn server according to this article by Jeff Atwood.\nIn contrast to VisualSVN win32svn is not so tightly integrated to Windows, orientated on terminal usage and open sourced under Apache License.\n\n\nA19:\n\nMy friends who run a Windows shop speak highly of VisualSVN\n\n\nA20:\n\nActually, I had this problem same as you.  You can get the \"Forbidden\" error if your commit includes different directories ; Like external items.\nAnd \u0131 solved in one step. Just commit external items in another case.\nAdditionally, I advise you to read articles on External Items in Subversion and VisualSVN Server:\nVisualSVN Team's article about Daily Use Guide External Items. It explains the principles of External Items in SVN.\nhttps://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-externals.html\n\n\nA21:\n\nThe Command Line Client from CollabNet, while it does have an installer for windows, all it asks you is where you want to put the files, and then finish.  Its just the command line client, like it says, nothing else.  Subversion doesn't distribute their own binaries.\n\nThe Subversion project does not\n  officially endorse or maintain any\n  binary packages of the Subversion\n  software. However, volunteers have\n  created binary packages for different\n  distributions and platforms, and as a\n  convenience, we maintain a list of\n  links to them here. If there are any\n  problems with or questions about the\n  different binary packages please send\n  email to the Subversion users mailing\n  list.\n\n\n\nA22:\n\nI, too, lost my overlays after upgrading to 1.6.8 on Windows 7 x64.  I only installed the x64 version and not the 32-bit version.  To fix, I ran a repair with the original installer and rebooted.  The overlays displayed normally thereafter.\n\n\nA23:\n\nSometimes you just need to go to TortoiseSVN \"settings\", turn the icons off, click \"apply\", turn them back on.\nWindows Start->All Programs->TortoiseSVN->Settings\n\n\n\nA24:\n\nIf you want to use Tortoise from within a 32 bit Application on Windows 7 64 bit, you need to install both the 64bit and the 32bit versions of Tortoise. According to Tortoise's makers, this works fine. (source)\n\n\nA25:\n\nHave you tried to change in Tortoise Settings the status cache to 'Default'? I had this problem with the overlay icon on folders because I had this option in 'Shell'.\nThe option is in Settings -> Icons overlay.\nMaybe this could help you http://tortoisesvn.net/node/97\n\n\nA26:\n\nYou can get the \"Forbidden\" error if your user account lacks access permissions to a repository or repository path; it makes sense to check authorization settings for your user account. Make sure your system administrator hasn't provided you with No Access permission to the repository path.\nIf you are sure that permissions are set correctly, then double-check the URL you use. URLs in Apache Subversion are case-sensitive.\nAdditionally, I advise you to read articles on authorization in Subversion and VisualSVN Server:\n\nSVNBook about path-based authorization.\nVisualSVN Team's article about path-based authorization. It explains the principles of SVN authorization by comparing it with Windows Access Control.\n\n\n\nA27:\n\nThe solution for me was to check the case sensitivity of the username. A lot of people are mentioning that the URL is case sensitive, but it seems the username is as well!\n\n\nA28:\n\nThe former direct links don't work, but the subversion project now provides several offsite links to Windows binaries:\nhttp://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#windows\n\n\nA29:\n\nI found that if you install the 32bit version first it some how mucks up the 64bit version. On reinstalling windows 7 i just installed the 64bit version and it seems to work fine now.\n\n\nA30:\n\nThey display fine here. Are you using the 64-bit version of Windows 7 along with the 32-bit version of TortoiseSVN? If so, then they will only show up in the 32-bit Explorer (or in the CFDs of 32-bit applications). You can install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions side-by-side, though.\n\n\nA31:\n\nI had a similar issue in Mac where svn was picking mac login as user name and I was getting error as\nsvn: E170013: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'https://repo:8443/svn/proj/trunk'\nsvn: E175013: Access to '/svn/proj/trunk' forbidden\n\nI used the --username along with svn command to pass the correct username which helped me.\nAlternatively, you can delete ~/.subversion/auth file, after which svn will prompt you for username.\n\n\nA32:\n\nHalt ye!\nBefore doing anything to your registry or similar procedures listed in Kris Erickson's (excellent) answer or the ones below, there's something to consider...\nAre you on a network drive?\nIf so, go to Tortoise SVN settings (right click any folder > TortoiseSVN > Settings), then go to 'Icon Overlays'\nMake sure you've checked 'Network Drives' as pictured:\n\nBy default on a fresh Tortoise install, network drives don't have the icons added.\nThis solved the problem for us. If this fails for you then obviously you can go through the (slightly) more involved solutions listed here.\n\n\nA33:\n\nIf you have recently upgraded Tortoise SVN, it may be because version 1.7 seems to need a new format for storing the status of files - in which case, you can right click the root folder of your repository in question, and use the Tortoise menu option of 'SVN Upgrade Working Copy'.\nThis resolved the problem for me. \nCheers\nMatt\n\n\nA34:\n\nMy issue was my SVN permissions.\nI had the same problem \"Access to '/svn/[my path]/!svn/me' forbidden\" when trying to commit files to a project I had been working on daily for several months.  After trying the steps above, I could not resolve the issue.  I also tried pulling the project down from scratch, logging in/out of SVN, etc.  Finally I contacted my company's IT department and there was a permissions issue that spontaneously emerged which changed my access from read/write to read-only access.  The IT department refreshed my permissions and this solved the problem. \n\n\nA35:\n\nI just upgraded to TSVN 1.6.8.19260 on a WinXP and two Win7 machines. After upgrading, the overlay icons disappeared on all 3 machines. Under the above mentioned registry key, I only found the entry for offline files.\nI simply had to reinstall/repair the TSVN installation and the icons reappeared after a reboot. I've never detected that behaviour in any previous TSVN version and I certainly installed TSVN everytime the same way with the same permissions.\n\n\nA36:\n\nPossible problems and solutions\n\nLimitation of number of usable overlay icons by Windows, refer to Kris Erickson's answer.\nInappropriate setting of TortoiseSVN, refer to Ralph Cowling's answer.\nKnown bug for updating from earlier version (pre 1.6.10), see here. \nTortoiseSVN was not installed for all users, try to install with cmd like below, if all below three solutions don't work, I believe this method will save your life.\n\n\nrem Set your own path.\nset TOOL_ROOT=d:\\Tools\\TortoiseSVN-1.6.13.20954-win32-svn-1.6.16\\tortoisesvn_1.6.16.21511\nset PACKAGENAME=TortoiseSVN-1.6.16.21511-x64-svn-1.6.17.msi\nset TOOL_INSTALLROOT=\"c:\\Program Files (x86)\\TortoiseSVN\"\n\nmsiexec /i \"%TOOL_ROOT%\\%PACKAGENAME%\" INSTALLDIR=%TOOL_INSTALLROOT% ALLUSERS=1 ARPSYSTEMCOMPONENT=1 RebootYesNo=No REBOOT=ReallySupress /qb-\n\nset ret=%ERRORLEVEL%\n\nrem The installer seems to return same values as MSI\nrem These codes mean that the product is properly installed, even though the code is not zero.\nrem 1641 ERROR_SUCCESS_REBOOT_INITIATED\nrem 3010 ERROR_SUCCESS_REBOOT_REQUIRED\nif %ret% EQU 1641 set ret=0\nif %ret% EQU 3010 set ret=0\nif %ret% GTR 0 exit %ret%\n\n\n\nA37:\n\nTo complete Johannes's answer, you can check this thread, which mentions another cause (the first one being installing the 32bit client instead of the 64 one) (emphasis mine):\n\nOnly more recent versions of TSVN and TCVS are able to share overlay icons, and since Explorer has a limit of 14 overlay images in total with extraneous overlay icons\n  simply not showing up you might have too many... \nIf it's overlay icons are showing up you'd have to actually be using\n  the 32-bit Windows Explorer, which of course means you'll have to also\n  install a 32-bit version of TSVN.\n\nThe issue might come up when one install also first TortoiseVCS, because:\n\nLooking at what got installed in the filesystem and the registry, it looks like they tried to do what I do with my Shell extensions - install both 64 and 32 -bit versions, so that nobody says \"I don't see my overlays/menus\"! ;)\nUnfortunately, it looks like the registry entries for 32-bit got hosed, so the 32-bit extension DLL, even though present, does not have the correct registry entries. \nIf in doubt I suggest to deinstall TCVS and TSVN.\n  Then install TSVN.\n  Maybe after installation reboot twice, not only once.\n  And if they still don't show up go to software control panel and choose to repair the installation. That did the trick for me with when upgrading from the previous to the current version.\nYou should probably install the TortoiseXYZ variant you plan to use mainly first, to improve its chances to fall into one of those limited number of overlay icons slots before the TortoiseXYZ variant you use less.\nAlways keep these limited number of overlay icon slots in mind when trying to analyze malfunctions. \n\n\n\nA38:\n\nIf the problem lies client side, this could be one of the causes of the error.\nOn clients TortoiseSVN saves client credentials under\n\nTortoise settings / saved data / authentication data.\n\nI got the same error trying to commit my files, but my credentials were changed. Clearing this cache here will give you a popup on next commit attempt for re-entering your correct credentials.\n\n\nA39:\n\nWe use an Apache SSPI module with the Collab.Net subversion server.\nHas worked perfectly for us.\n\n\nA40:\n\nIn my case, Dropbox overlays were starting with a \" (quoted identifier) in the registry. I deleted all the \" prefixes and restarted explorer.exe. \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\explorer\\ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers\n\nEdit: I installed Windows 10 and this solution didn't work for me. So I just went to the same registry location and deleted all Google and SkyDrive records and restarted explorer.exe. \nSecond edit: After installing TortoiseGit it fixed everything without any customisation. \n\n\nA41:\n\nPutting in a vote for CollabNet Subversion Edge, it's dead simple to set up and administer via a web frontend. I'm comfortable editing config files if I must, especially coming from a Linux environment, but it's nice not to be required to do so - CollabNet makes that easy.\n\n\nA42:\n\nI was unable to commit csharp-files (*.cs). In the end the problem was that at some point i installed mod_mono, which made the *.cs-files inaccessible, through its configuration. So it may well be an apache-configuration issue, if only some sort of files are not accessible.\ngrep \".cs\" /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*\n...\nmod_mono_auto.conf:AddType application/x-asp-net .cs\n...\n\n\n\n\nThink briefly about which candidate is the best answer.\nThen respond with ONLY the ID of the best answer, for example: A3.\n", "completion": "\nA11"}
